Prompt 2 - Hybrid Creature:
"Create a stunning hybrid creature that combines the physical features of a [first animal] and a [second animal]. Place the creature in the same environment as the previous prompt to ensure background consistency."

🔧 Steps:
Brainstorm your idea for hybrid animals.
Use ChatGPT to generate the prompts.
